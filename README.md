# HighScores
HighScores is a project that covers sorting algorithms that was created to add to CS499 ePortfolio.

## Specifications
HighScores begins by calling `RandomScoresGenerator.java` to generate a random integer array called `scores` sized at 100_000 with values from 0 up to 100_000_000. The resulting array is then set to `selectionSortArray` and `mergeSortArray` to calculate each algorithm's duration of execution once they are called.
